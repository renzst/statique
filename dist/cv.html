            <blockquote>
                I am primarily driven by my engagement in local and regional issues and my desire to facilitate and effect lasting social upheaval and revolution. I am fascinated by navigating and mapping physical and social geography. At the surface, I am pursuing a deepening of my knowledge and capabilities to navigate urban forms, their governance, and social power. At my core, I want to facilitate an urban form that is anti-hierarchical and autonomous.
