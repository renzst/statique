# Free Grocery Store

I helped found and continue to coordinate the [Gainesville Free Grocery Store](https://gnvfgs.org). We are a mutual aid operation that delivers free food biweekly to over 350 Gainesville residents across 120 households experiencing food insecurity. We also operate a no-questions-asked walk up pantry, and mobile distributions in select neighborhoods.

Free Grocery Store began as a small food diversion project hosted by the [Civic Media Center](https://civicmediacenter.org) that served 20 to 30 people. At the onset of the COVID pandemic in March 2020, with the flourishing of mutual aid efforts amidst crisis, I created a logistics to pack and deliver food while maintaining social distancing. We source food currently from [Bread of the Mighty Food Bank](https://breadofthemighty.org) and allied grocery stores. We are entirely community-supported - currently we receive no grant funding.

I initially bottom-lined packing/delivering operations and created/maintained a database for our use. Currently, I manage client relations and communications, oversee our incorporation as a non-profit, expansion of our mobile distribution program, and building our website. We are working on a migration of our database onto our server as well as building an app for use by drivers.
