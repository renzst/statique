# Farm 2 Neighbors

I am also an organizer and volunteer of (Farm 2 Neighbors)[https://instagram.com/farm2n]. Farm 2 Neighbors is a food redistribution program with a hyper-local scope of the Kincaid Loop, a number of neighborhoods off Alachua County Road 2043, otherwise SE 15th St, SE 42nd Ave, and SE 27th St.

Farm 2 Neighbors was originally the idea of a Gainesville woman, Tuesday. At the beginning of the 2020 COVID pandemic, large food supply excesses were created due to social distancing guidelines and lockdowns, include surpluses from local farms in Gainesville. Tuesday wanted to distribute the excess from local organic farms (Siembra Farm)[https://siembrafarm.com/] and (The Family Garden)[https://www.thefamilygardencsa.com/] to local neighbors. Eventually, Tuesday left Gainesville and another Gainesville woman, Brackin, took over the project with the help of volunteer organizers.

Beneath the surface of a simple food redistribution, Farm 2 Neighbors attempts to address the racial politics of the Kincaid Loop. As a whole, the Loop is racially mixed. However, upper middle class white people occupy large tracts of acreage within the loop, particularly within the center in the so-called (Flamingo Hammock)[https://web.archive.org/web/20220506153628/https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/environment/2016/10/01/neighbors-pull-together-to-restore-sandhill-landscape/25277547007/], whereas Black families and low-income white families tend to occupy 1970s suburban boom neighborhoods. The organic farms that occupy the center of the loop are white-owned as well, operating within the framework of black neighborhoods. Farm 2 Neighbors is a way of connecting neighborhoods of the Loop using food as the unifier.

Farm 2 Neighbors originally operated off of the excesses produced by the farm, but as of 2022 we are trying to stabilize the effort in the long term by ensuring that some produce grown by the farms is grown specifically for the neighborhood.
