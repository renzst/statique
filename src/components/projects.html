            <p>This is an extension of the <a href="#ac-food-desert">Alachua County Food Desert project</a> that maps the relative locations and densities of supermarkets versus convenience stores and other access points that don't sell fresh fruits and vegetables. This is mapped as a quotient of network distance to nearest convenience store (or similar) over network distance to nearest supermarket. The quotient is relative, rather than absolute - it is compared to the entire dataset.</p>

                    <p>A map of food access quotients in Alachua County. Areas in black represent non-residential areas. A lower quotient (in purple) indicates that relative to the average, food access points without fruits and vegetables are much closer/more accessible than supermarkets. A higher quotient (in green) indicates the opposite.</p>
                    <p>In general, areas across the County with low food access quotients include Waldo, Fairbanks, west Hawthorne, East Gainesville, Archer, Turkey Creek, and High Springs.</p>

                    <p>A map of food access quotients focused on Gainesville. Areas in black represent non-residential areas. A lower quotient (in purple) indicates that relative to the average, food access points without fruits and vegetables are much closer/more accessible than supermarkets. A higher quotient (in green) indicates the opposite.</p>
                    <p>High food access quotients include much of Northwest Gainesville and a residential area between Tower and Parker Roads in outlying West Gainesville. East Gainesville generally has a low food access quotient.</p>

            <h2 tabindex="0">Food Deserts of Alachua County</h2>
            <p>This is a short project that maps out the location of food deserts in Alachua County at the rural scale, and in Gainesville at the local scale. This is a short project I undertook at the beginning of the pandemic to better understand areas Free Grocery Store would be working in, as well as a way of mapping what conventional food access points exist in the County and surrounding areas. Distances were mapped using network distances on roads, not Euclidean "crow's" distance.</p>

                    <p>In this analysis, Waldo and Micanopy were found to be much further away than the county average.</p>

                    <p>East Gainesville had the highest average distances away from supermarkets, with many areas more than 2.5 miles away from the nearest supermarket.</p>
